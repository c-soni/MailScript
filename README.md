# MailScript
A simple emailing script using mutt to notify you of your build completion and status.

Requires mutt to be installed and configured. [These steps](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mutt#Configuration) should help in the process.

Really small script, comments should suffice as documentation.
